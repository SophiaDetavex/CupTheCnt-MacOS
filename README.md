# CupTheCunt
**Usage**
```
  ctc <CupList> <Contents>
```
CupList is the Cuplist and Contents is Contents.cnt  
Given these files it will produce a folder called "updates" and extract all CIAs to that folder  
note that CIAs in there aren't retail ready either and you will need seprate tools for that

This is for use with extracted ROMFS from 
*Nintendo 3ds Dev CSU updaters
*Nintendo 3ds SD SNAKE System Updaters
<sub>And no I won't help you find them</sub>
